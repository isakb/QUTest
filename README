QUTest is a QUnit based unit test runner. It was mainly created for
simplifying the execution of unit tests from the command line with
phantomjs.

===================================
Running tests from the command line
===================================

In order to run tests with phantomjs from the commandline you need to
install phantomjs on your machine, and then run:

./run TESTFILE_1 [...[TESTFILE_N]]


Instructions for building phantomjs are found there:
http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstructions

Your testcases should be written in JavaScript (or possibly compiled
from e.g.  CoffeeScript to JavaScript) and can make use of either or
both of QUnit and Pavlov.


It's possible to customize ouput a bit, e.g.:

./run test*.js --show-colors=0 --show-page-console=1 --show-passed-tests=1

(Check the CONFIG in test-runner.coffee for more possible configurations.)


===================================
Running tests from any web browsers
===================================

You can also run the tests from any browser.

Example: To run tests from ./example.js and ./example2.js, open this
URL in your web browser:
file://`pwd`/test.html?injects=example.js,example2.js

(Replace `pwd` with the full path to the current directory.)


For your convenience, when tests are executed with phantomjs from the
command line the test runner will also print the corresponding URL for
the tests, so that you can easily run the tests in your browser(s) as
well.
